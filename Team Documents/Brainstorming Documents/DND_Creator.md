# **DND Creator Website**

## Description
One common problem that many dungeon master's face is when they write an extensively planned out session but the players decide to go elsewhere and avoid the planned material, usually by accident. This leaves the dungeon master having to come up with interesting encounters, fights, and npcs on the fly. The purpose of this app would be to allow a DM to get monsters and npcs on the fly to incorporate into their off the rails session. To do this the DM would be able to fill out a form to help curate what kind of monster or npc they want. This is where our algorithmic component would come in as the app would calculate stats based on the dnd 5e rules and what the dm entered. It may also be possible for the DM to enter very little and a completely random monster or npc be created. For an api we would use open api or something similar to get a picture to go with the creation and possibly even a short backstory for the npcs. After something has been created the DM can choose to save the creation or reroll various parts that they may want to change. After being saved the DM can access it at any time. All data for the creation will be displayed in a style similar to the traditional dnd character sheet or monster stats page.
