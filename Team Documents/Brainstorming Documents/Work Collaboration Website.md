# **Work Collaboration Website**

## Description
A website intended for hobbyists to find projects to work on. Projects will have an owner, collaborators, description, skills sought, main field (ex: "Art" or "Tech"), started/in-progress development status, 3 to 5 other subject tags, an open/regulated/closed collaboration status, and an optional preview image.  Projects can be searched for based on subject tags, skills or main field. 

Description and preview images will have content moderation. "Open" projects can be be joined by anyone. For "Regulated" projects, users must submit a collaboration request and be accepted to work on the project. The owner of the project may grant current collaborators permission to accept or deny incoming collaboration requests. Users may be temporarily or permanently banned from a project if they spam the project with collaboration requests. 

If the project has not been updated in some way (image, description, subject tags, or skills sought) after a given period of time, the project will be marked as "potentially dormant". Users must sign up with an account to be a collaborator. An account will have a username and profile description. All accounts have a limit on the number projects they can be listed as a collaborator at a given time.
