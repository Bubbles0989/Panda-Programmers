Spotify Project Inception Worksheet
=====================================

## Summary of Our Approach to Software Development 
    We will be using an agile approach to this project and will be using Scrum as our main workflow. 

## Initial Vision Discussion with Stakeholders
    For spotify listeners who need a new unique playlist, the spotify management studio will provide a way to create a new playlist for 
    them. The studio will ask the user a series of questions that will then be converted into a playlist and placed into that users spotify account. The studio will also have a section that recommends tracks and displays episodes and podcasts. The main page will display a users generated playlists as well as their other playlists, episodes, audiobooks and podcasts. 

### Description of Clients/Users
    Anyone who uses spotify and needs a new playlist. Anyone who wants to discover new music based off of what they like or what they feel like listening to.
    Anyone who wants to make new playlists quickly and easily. 

### List of Stakeholders and their Positions (if applicable)
