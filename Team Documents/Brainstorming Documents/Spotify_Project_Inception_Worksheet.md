Spotify Project Inception Worksheet
=====================================

## Summary of Our Approach to Software Development 
    We will be using an agile approach to this project and will be using Scrum as our main workflow. 

## Initial Vision Discussion with Stakeholders
    
    For Spotify users who need a means to collaborate with other users, upload their own music, a way to filter their songs easier, get recommendations on the fly, play music with their friends utilizing polls, and customize their own interfaces. The Music Collaboration Manager adds a way to communicate with other users via allowing them to make collaborative playlists together that will then be saved to their spotify accounts. They will be able to upload and post their own music to their playlists, making it easy to share their own tracks. Through the use of a forum, users will be able to communicate with one another to discuss their music to promote their artistic abilities. The auto generated playlists will be generated via a questionaire that the user fills out and then it calculates the song list as well as adds an ai generated image and an ai generated description. The Manager will add a better tagging system to user playlists that allow them to filter the songs according to several different categories. The recommendations tab will display a list of recommended tracks based on the songs in the users playlists in a clean fashion. All of the interfaces tabs will be customizable by the user. Finally, users will be able to vote on the tracks to be played in public spaces such as a coffee shop or a work environment, giving them control over what they listen to during the day. 

### Description of Clients/Users

## Initial Requirements Elaboration and Elicitation
    See Requirements_template for more

### Elicitation Questions
    1. What features do you wish spotify had?
    2. Do you want a similar style as spotify?
    3. Who is the intended audience for this application?

## List of Needs and Features 
    Needs
    1. Allow users to experience music based on their current social cicles.
    2. Allow users to use content that matches their current mood.
    3. Make it easier for users to share music based on their tastes.

    Features
    1. Playlist Generator Questionaire
        -- Allow the user to find songs based on questions that suit their current mood.

    2. Add other users as friends
        -- Give users the opportunity to recommend songs to each other based on specific song traits and provide feedback about the recommened song.

    3. Spotify Authentication and Display
        -- Allow users to sign in with their spotify account. They would be capable of playing songs currently in their playlist. The display would also be improved to show the number of times a specific song has been played.

    4. Collaboritive Playlists
        -- Allow users to make a playlist together.

    5. Customizability
        -- Users can customize the site. This would include the site's color scheme (when logged in) and the track widget to their preferred color.
