# **Playlist Maker Website**

## Description
A web based application that asks the user to input a genre or a vibe and generates a spotify playlist for them using the spotify api. The playlist would be provided via an image that has the names of the songs and provides a spotify code on it. Could use an ai api to help in the process of generating that image. The authentication would be having the user login to spotify so we could plop the playlist directly into their account. The process of asking the user could be a questionaire of sorts that would calculate what genre of songs would be best for the user and randomly collect songs for the playlist.
