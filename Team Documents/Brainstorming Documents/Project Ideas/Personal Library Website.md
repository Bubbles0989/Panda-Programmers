# **Personal Library Website**

## Description
For this website, a user will be able to have a single tool for every need they might have in regards to keeping up with their own library catalog. This website will be able to keep track of the users books and store them in a relational database, it will use the ISBN number to keep track of the books and will have the capability to use a barcode scanner to be able to input new books to the database. The user will be able to add, remove and edit their own catalog of books. We do have a concept for this site to have a mobile application as well allowing users to use their phones to scan the barcodes of their books. The user will also be able to get reccommended books for their catalog based off of many different search queriers, including mood, genre, author, number of pages, type, location, standalone vs. series. It will search across the web for the right books and return back to the user a list of books from many different sources.
