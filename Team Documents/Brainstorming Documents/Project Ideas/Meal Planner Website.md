# **Meal Planner Website**

## Description
A web app makes use of the recipe-food-nutrition API in order to make meal prep easy. This API will tell you both the cost of ingredients and what you can make from ingredients you already have. With this functionality we would be able to expand it in order to make an easy to use meal planning or last minute dinner preparation app. For the algorithm I am thinking of using the API features to not only show recipes that users already have ingredients for, but show recipes that they almost have all the ingredients too. This would allow users to avoid wasting food and go to the grocery store to shop for recipes that contain ingredients that they almost have all the ingredients to. To add to this we could also make use of the APIâ€™s functionality and give suggestions for replacements based on what a user has specified that they have. The other way this API could be used is to plan costs when meal planning. The API provides a cost for specific ingredients. With this we could make an algorithm that keeps track of the budget that a user provides. If we do make the first function mentioned, then we could also combine it with that and show the use what recipes that are close to making that would fit within their budget to get the rest of the ingredients for. There are several other things that this API can do, such as wine pairing foods, that we may make use of in our web app.
