## Music Management Project 🎵

#### Vision Statement 👁️
>For Spotify users who need a means to collaborate with other users, upload their own music, a way to filter their songs easier, get recommendations on the fly, play music with their friends utilizing polls, and customize their own interfaces. The Music Collaboration Manager adds a way to communicate with other users via allowing them to make collaborative playlists together that will then be saved to their spotify accounts. They will be able to upload and post their own music to their playlists, making it easy to share their own tracks. Through the use of a forum, users will be able to communicate with one another to discuss their music to promote their artistic abilities. The auto generated playlists will be generated via a questionaire that the user fills out and then it calculates the song list as well as adds an ai generated image and an ai generated description. The Manager will add a better tagging system to user playlists that allow them to filter the songs according to several different categories. The recommendations tab will display a list of recommended tracks based on the songs in the users playlists in a clean fashion. All of the interfaces tabs will be customizable by the user. Finally, users will be able to vote on the tracks to be played in public spaces such as a coffee shop or a work environment, giving them control over what they listen to during the day.
